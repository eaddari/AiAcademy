Masudul Islam, Kh Abdullah Al-Aff, Shams Ibne Karim, Md. Kabir Uddin Sikder', 'abstract': "Skin cancer is a global health concern, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis for improved patient outcomes. This study introduces a groundbreaking approach to skin cancer classification, employing the Vision Transformer, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture renowned for its success in diverse image analysis tasks. Utilizing the HAM10000 dataset of 10,015 meticulously annotated skin lesion images, the model undergoes preprocessing for enhanced robustness. The Vision Transformer, adapted to the skin cancer classification task, leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture intricate spatial dependencies, achieving superior performance over traditional deep learning architectures. Segment Anything Model aids in precise segmentation of cancerous areas, attaining high IOU and Dice Coefficient. Extensive experiments highlight the model's supremacy, particularly the Google-based ViT patch-32 variant, which achieves 96.15% accuracy and showcases potential as an effective tool for dermatologists in skin cancer diagnosis, contributing to advancements in dermatological practices.", 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04746v1'}], 'deep reinforcement learning large-scale experimentation and scaling challenges': [{'title': 'Value from Observations: Towards Large-Scale Imitation Learning via Self-Improvement', 'authors': 'Michael Bloesch, Markus Wulfmeier, Philemon Brakel, Todor Davchev, Martina Zambelli, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Abbas Abdolmaleki, William F Whitney, Nicolas Heess, Roland Hafner, Martin Riedmiller', 'abstract': 'Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) offers a powerful way to learn behaviors at large-scale: Unlike behavior cloning or offline reinforcement learning, IfO can leverage action-free demonstrations and thus circumvents the need for costly action-labeled demonstrations or reward functions. However, current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast, this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06701v1'}], 'machine learning fairness explainability and interpretability methods': [{'title': 'Fair MP-BOOST: Fair and Interpretable Minipatch Boosting', 'authors': 'Camille Olivia Little, Genevera I. Allen', 'abstract': 'Ensemble methods, particularly boosting, have established themselves as highly effective and widely embraced machine learning techniques for tabular data. In this paper, we aim to leverage the robust predictive power of traditional boosting methods while enhancing fairness and interpretability. To achieve this, we develop Fair MP-Boost, a stochastic boosting scheme that balances fairness and accuracy by adaptively learning features and observations during training. Specifically, Fair MP-Boost sequentially samples small subsets of observations and features, termed minipatches (MP), according to adaptively learned feature and observation sampling probabilities. We devise these probabilities by combining loss functions, or by combining feature importance scores to address accuracy and fairness simultaneously. Hence, Fair MP-Boost prioritizes important and fair features along with challenging instances, to select the most relevant minipatches for learning. The learned probability distributions also yield intrinsic interpretations of feature importance and important observations in Fair MP-Boost. Through empirical evaluation of simulated and benchmark datasets, we showcase the interpretability, accuracy, and fairness of Fair MP-Boost.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01521v1'}], 'privacy-preserving machine learning federated learning and differential privacy': [{'title': 'Differentially Private Federated Learning: A Systematic Review', 'authors': 'Jie Fu, Yuan Hong, Xinpeng Ling, Leixia Wang, Xun Ran, Zhiyu Sun, Wendy Hui Wang, Zhili Chen, Yang Cao', 'abstract': 'In recent years, privacy and security concerns in machine learning have promoted trusted federated learning to the forefront of research. Differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for privacy protection in federated learning due to its rigorous mathematical foundation and provable guarantee. Despite extensive research on algorithms that incorporate differential privacy within federated learning, there remains an evident deficiency in systematic reviews that categorize and synthesize these studies.   Our work presents a systematic overview of the differentially private federated learning. Existing taxonomies have not adequately considered objects and level of privacy protection provided by various differential privacy models in federated learning. To rectify this gap, we propose a new taxonomy of differentially private federated learning based on definition and guarantee of various differential privacy models and federated scenarios. Our classification allows for a clear delineation of the protected objects across various differential privacy models and their respective neighborhood levels within federated learning environments. Furthermore, we explore the applications of differential privacy in federated learning scenarios. Our work provide valuable insights into privacy-preserving federated learning and suggest practical directions for future research.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08299v3'}], 'MLOps scalable production-grade machine learning systems and continuous deployment': [{'title': 'Exploring MLOps Dynamics: An Experimental Analysis in a Real-World Machine Learning Project', 'authors': "Awadelrahman M.
