The Role of Sampling and Legal Content Analysis in Systemic Risk Assessments and Independent Audits in the Digital Services Act', 'authors': 'Marie-Therese Sekwenz, Rita Gsenger, Scott Dahlgren, Ben Wagner', 'abstract': "A central requirement of the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) is that online platforms undergo internal and external audits.

This article evaluates the strengths and limitations of different qualitative and quantitative methods for auditing these systemic risks and proposes a mixed-method approach for DSA compliance. We argue that content sampling, combined with legal and empirical analysis, offers a viable method for risk-specific audits. First, we examine relevant legal provisions on sample selection for audit purposes. We then assess sampling techniques and methods suitable for detecting systemic risks, focusing on how representativeness can be understood across disciplines. Finally, we review initial systemic risk assessment reports submitted by platforms, analyzing their testing and sampling methodologies. By proposing a structured, mixed-method approach tailored to specific risk categories and platform characteristics, this article addresses the challenge of evidence-based audits under the DSA. Our contribution emphasizes the need for adaptable, context-sensitive auditing strategies and adds to the emerging field of DSA compliance research.", 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03601v1'}], 'evaluation of internal controls and substantive testing methodologies in auditing': [{'title': 'Doing Audits Right?

This requirement belies a certain degree of dynamicity when estimating the constituent parts of a credit loss event, most notably the probability of default (PD). It is notoriously difficult to produce such PD-estimates at every point of loan life that are adequately dynamic and accurate, especially when considering the ever-changing macroeconomic background. In rendering these lifetime PD-estimates, the choice of modelling technique plays an important role, which is why we first review a few classes of techniques, including the merits and limitations of each. Our main contribution however is the development of an in-depth and data-driven tutorial using a particular class of techniques called discrete-time survival analysis. This tutorial is accompanied by a diverse set of reusable diagnostic measures for evaluating various aspects of a survival model and the underlying data. A comprehensive R-based codebase is further contributed. We believe that our work can help cultivate common modelling practices under IFRS 9, and should be valuable to practitioners, model validators, and regulators alike.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15441v1'}], 'fraud detection and forensic audit techniques using data analytics': [{'title': 'A Review of Financial Accounting Fraud Detection based on Data Mining Techniques', 'authors': 'Anuj Sharma, Prabin Kumar Panigrahi', 'abstract': 'With an upsurge in financial accounting fraud in the current economic scenario experienced, financial accounting fraud detection (FAFD) has become an emerging topic of great importance for academic, research and industries. The failure of internal auditing system of the organization in identifying the accounting frauds has lead to use of specialized procedures to detect financial accounting fraud, collective known as forensic accounting. Data mining techniques are providing great aid in financial accounting fraud detection, since dealing with the large data volumes and complexities of financial data are big challenges for forensic accounting. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature on the application of data mining techniques for the detection of financial accounting fraud and proposes a framework for data mining techniques based accounting fraud detection. The systematic and comprehensive literature review of the data mining techniques applicable to financial accounting fraud detection may provide a foundation to future research in this field. The findings of this review show that data mining techniques like logistic models, neural networks, Bayesian belief network, and decision trees have been applied most extensively to provide primary solutions to the problems inherent in the detection and classification of fraudulent data.', 'year': 2013, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3944v1'}], 'audit technology integration with ERP systems, automation, and big data analytics': [{'title': 'Open ERP System Data For Occupational Fraud Detection', 'authors': 'Julian Tritscher, Fabian Gwinner, Daniel Schl√∂r, Anna Krause, Andreas Hotho', 'abstract': 'Recent estimates report that companies lose 5% of their revenue to occupational fraud. Since most medium-sized and large companies employ Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to track vast amounts of information regarding their business process, researchers have in the past shown interest in automatically detecting fraud through ERP system data. Current research in this area, however, is hindered by the fact that ERP system data is not publicly available for the development and comparison of fraud detection methods. We therefore endeavour to generate public ERP system data that includes both normal business operation and fraud. We propose a strategy for generating ERP system data through a serious game, model a variety of fraud scenarios in cooperation with auditing experts, and generate data from a simulated make-to-stock production company with multiple research participants. We aggregate the generated data into ready to used datasets for fraud detection in ERP systems, and supply both the raw and aggregated data to the general public to allow for open development and comparison of fraud detection approaches on ERP system data.', 'year': 2022, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04460v3'}]}
