# Efficient Study Plan Structure for Becoming a Better Entry-Level AI Engineer

> _Estimated time commitment: 8–12 hours/week recommended. Most modules can be completed in 1–3 weeks. Adjust based on your prior knowledge and available time. Strive for steady progress rather than speed, balancing foundational mastery with project work. This plan is layered: finish core modules before advancing to more complex AI and deep learning concepts. Expect a total journey of 3–5 months for solid outcomes, but progress may be faster for motivated or experienced learners._
