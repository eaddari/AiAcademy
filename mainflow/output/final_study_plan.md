    - **Professional Ethics:** Integrity, due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior, as outlined by normative ethical codes (see OIC and ISA Italia for official principles).
- **Key Standards:** 
    - OIC (Italian GAAP): Framework for preparing Italian company accounts.
    - IFRS: Required for listed and multinational companies.
    - D.Lgs 39/2010: Legislative decree on statutory audits in Italy.
    - Consob Regulations: Additional rules for listed entities.

    - **Prudence (prudenza):** Do not overstate income/assets.
    - **Going Concern:** Assume business will continue.

## 3. Core Accounting Principles *(4 days – Beginner to Intermediate)*

### a. Double-Entry Bookkeeping

- **Concepts:**  
    - Every transaction affects at least two accounts (debit/credit system).
    - **Assets:** Increased by debits, decreased by credits.
    - **Liabilities/Equity:** Increased by credits, decreased by debits.
- **Practical:**  
    - Record a sales invoice: Debit Accounts Receivable, Credit Sales Revenue.
    - Record rent payment: Debit Rent Expense, Credit Cash.
- **Checkpoint:** Short quiz—classify normal balance (debit or credit) for common accounts.
- **Example:**  
    - Sales Invoice Entry:  
        - Debit: Accounts Receivable €1,000  
        - Credit: Sales Revenue €1,000

- [QuickBooks Online Test Drive](https://qbo.intuit.com/redir/testdrive)

---

### b. The Accounting Cycle

- **Process:**  
    - Open balances → record daily transactions → adjust (e.g., accruals, depreciation) → closing entries (revenues/expenses shifted to equity) → post-closing trial balance.
- **Tasks:**  
    - Make adjusting entries: e.g., Accrue utilities at period end.
    - Prepare trial balance.
- **Checkpoint:** Enter and close two transactions (e.g., accrued revenue, prepaid expense).
- **Example:**  
    - Accrued Utility Expense at year-end:  
        - Debit: Utility Expense  
        - Credit: Utilities Payable

- **Consistency:**  
    - Retained earnings; net income/loss flows from Income Statement to Equity in Balance Sheet.
