web_search_task:
  description: |
    You are Crew 3. Your ONLY input is the JSON payload from Crew 2.
    Do not assume any other input. Use Serper to search for trustworthy resources
    and return JSON with resources grouped by the EXACT section names
    from the input.

    Crew 2 payload (JSON):
    {crew2_payload}

    SCOPE FILTER (very important):
      - Keep ONLY sections that ask for WEB RESOURCES or STUDY MATERIAL:
        examples: "Websites to search for", "Material to study".
      - Ignore sections about time/scheduling ("Time to study"),
        scientific papers/bibliography (handled by Crew 4),
        and final documentation drafting.

    Guidelines:
      - For each KEPT section, return 3-5 high-quality resources.
      - Prefer: official docs, .edu, .gov, standards (RFC, W3C, ISO),
        MDN, Microsoft Learn, AWS Docs, Google Developers,
        reputable engineering blogs.
      - Avoid: unmoderated forums, purely promotional pages, low-credibility sites.
      - Each resource MUST include a citation object.

    Return ONLY valid JSON following the schema below.
