## Sample Timeline & Commitment Guidelines

- **Section 1 (Foundations):** ~4-6 weeks (1 hr/day or 5-7 hrs/week)
- **Section 2 (Core AI):** ~4 weeks
- **Section 3 (Projects & Application):** ~4-6 weeks
- **Section 4 (Dev Skills):** Parallel with above, allocate weekly time
- **Section 5 (Network & Career):** Ongoing, 1-2 hrs/week
- **Section 6 (Mindset, Assessment, Next Steps):** Interwoven, periodic focus

_Tune the pacing to your needs—consistency matters more than speed._
