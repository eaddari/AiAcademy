rationale: The question concerns an AI engineer with no experience and LLM from scratch,
  likely referring to building large language models. The answer provides information
  about the role (Entry-Level AI Engineer) and the current knowledge level (Beginner),
  which is partially relevant as it addresses the starting position and skill level
  tied to the query context.
