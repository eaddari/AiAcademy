rationale: The question is about an AI engineer with no experience and building an
  LLM from scratch. The answer identifies the role as 'Entry-Level AI Engineer' and
  the knowledge level as 'Beginner.' These details are partially relevant as they
  pertain to the experience and skill level mentioned in the question, but do not
  address building an LLM from scratch. However, the answer contains some relevant
  information regarding the experience level.
