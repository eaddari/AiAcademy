There are no indications that this input is seeking to facilitate or engage in plagiarism, cheating, or any form of academic dishonesty. The request does not reference the copying of protected content, improper use of intellectual property, or attempts to bypass institutional policies. Based on the content, the input is consistent with a legitimate educational or research inquiry.\\n\\nAny Red Flags or Concerns Identified:\\n- None observed regarding unethical intent or policy violations.\\n- The abbreviation \\\"llm\\\" is assumed to mean \\\"Large Language Model.\\\" It would be beneficial to clarify this if there is any ambiguity.\\n- As a stand-alone phrase, the input lacks explicit detail but contains no evidence of problematic ethical conduct.\\n\\nRecommendations for Ethical Research Approach:\\n- If this is a topic or project outline, ensure all further queries and research activities adhere to strict academic integrity: cite sources, do not copy code or text verbatim unless properly attributed, and avoid using AI models to complete assessed coursework without disclosed permission.\\n- Engage with appropriate resources, tutorials, or academic mentors while learning or building an LLM to support ethical learning and professional development.\\n- If seeking guidance for a formal assignment or research project, always verify institutional policies regarding external assistance or tool use.\\n\\nAcademic Integrity Score: 10/10\\n\\nSummary: The input is ethically sound, appropriately scoped for legitimate educational or research purposes, and contains no evidence of intent to cheat, plagiarize, or circumvent academic policies. It is approved for academic or professional inquiry provided future activities maintain this high standard of integrity.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nSecurity Assessment Report\\n\\nSecurity Status: SAFE\\n\\nThreat Level Assessment: LOW\\n\\nSpecific Security Concerns Identified:\\n- Injection Attempts: None detected. The input contains only standard ASCII letters, commas, and spaces, with no signs of SQL injection payloads, shell commands, or suspicious code fragments.\\n- Social Engineering Patterns: No indications of attempts to manipulate, deceive, or extract sensitive information. The input is descriptive and contextually relevant.\\n- Attempts to Access Unauthorized Information: No requests for system data, user information, or restricted resources are present.\\n- Malicious URLs or Suspicious Links: No URLs, hyperlinks, or domain references are found in the input.\\n- Data Exfiltration Attempts: There is no evidence of encoded data, exfiltration vectors, or patterns typical of data leakage.\\n- System Exploitation Attempts: The input does not contain buffer overflows, script payloads, malformed strings, or other recognized system exploitation patterns.\\n\\nRisk Mitigation Recommendations:\\n- Continue to enforce context-sensitive input validation—ensure all future user-submitted data is subject to length restrictions, character whitelisting, and sanitization where appropriate.\\n- Monitor for ambiguous abbreviations (like \\\"llm\\\"); clarifying their intended meaning can help maintain communication clarity and prevent misinterpretation in more sensitive contexts.\\n- Encourage users to submit clearly structured data (using separate fields for roles, experience, projects, etc.) to further minimize the risk of unintended input handling or parsing issues.\\n- Regularly audit input handling logic to ensure no new vectors for injection or exploitation are inadvertently introduced as system features evolve.\\n\\nSafe Usage Guidelines:\\n- Accept similar inputs for informational, learning, or research purposes, as long as they are free of executable code, external links, or direct requests for unauthorized data.\\n- Maintain best practices for input processing, such as context-aware escaping and avoiding the direct execution of user-supplied content in any command context.\\n- Educate users to avoid sharing credentials, secret tokens, or proprietary information through input fields, even in innocuous contexts.\\n- Should further interaction with the input be required (e.g., as part of a workflow), process and store the data in a secure and access-controlled environment.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe provided input (\\\"ai engineer, no experience, llm from scratch\\\") is structurally simple, free from known security threats, and appropriate for further processing within the described context. There is no evidence of malicious intent, exploitation attempts, or social engineering risk. The input is deemed SAFE, with a LOW threat level and no immediate security actions required beyond standard best practices.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nEntry-Level AI Engineer\", \"tools\": []}", "role": "\"Knowledge Level Identifier\\n\"", "inject_date": "\"False\"", "date_format": "\"%Y-%m-%d\"", "guardrail_max_retries": "\"3\"", "goal": "\"Assess the user's current knowledge level based on their input and context.\\n\"", "agent_executor": "\"<crewai.agents.crew_agent_executor.CrewAgentExecutor object at 0x000002894661E780>\"", "callbacks": "\"[]\"", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"Beginner\"", "agent_ops_agent_name": "\"Knowledge Level Identifier\\n\"", "mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"tr-673531415bcaa81f536b4d46947be4fd\"", "allow_delegation": "\"False\"", "cache": "\"True\"", "multimodal": "\"False\"", "security_config": "\"version='1.0.0' fingerprint=Fingerprint(uuid_str='935deadf-39a9-4abb-8f32-ef0b58c4efe6', created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 9, 7, 23, 16, 52, 83084), metadata={})\"", "cache_handler": "\"\"", "tools_results": "\"[]\"", "crew": "\"parent_flow=<__main__.Flow object at 0x0000028911B2C440> name='crew' cache=True tasks=[Task(description=Analyze the user input: \\\"ai engineer, no experience, llm from scratch\\\"\\nCheck for: 1.

This will ensure all beginners can follow without searching for external definitions.\\\",\\n    \\\"- Where possible, provide estimated timeframes or suggested pacing for each section/module (e.g., 2 weeks for Core Foundations, 1 week for Introduction to AI Concepts). This helps learners create a realistic timeline and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\\\",\\n    \\\"- Consider summarizing the major milestones or checkpoints at the end of each section. This gives learners clear tangible outcomes to look for before proceeding.\\\",\\n    \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"Engagement:\\\",\\n    \\\"- Add prompts for reflection or self-journaling at intervals (for example: 'After completing a mini project, describe what you learned, what challenged you, and what you’d do differently.').

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level.

Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level.

In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search.

This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly.

While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level.

Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search.

Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\", \"plan\": \"# Efficient Study Plan Structure for Becoming a Better Entry-Level AI Engineer\\n\\n> _Estimated time commitment: 8–12 hours/week recommended.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly. Current AI governance approaches consist mainly of manual review and documentation processes. While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\\n\", \"name\": \"fill_final_plan\", \"expected_output\": \"The final structured plan in markdown format.\\n\", \"summary\": \"Fill in the final study plan with the resources and...\", \"raw\": \"# Efficient Study Plan Structure for Becoming a Better Entry-Level AI Engineer\\n\\n> _Estimated time commitment: 8–12 hours/week recommended.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly.

While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\\n\"", "guardrail_max_retries": "\"3\"", "name": "\"fill_final_plan\"", "async_execution": "\"False\"", "used_tools": "\"0\"", "create_directory": "\"True\"", "markdown": "\"False\"", "human_input": "\"False\"", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"description\": \"Fill in the final study plan with the resources and papers found by the previous agents.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly. Current AI governance approaches consist mainly of manual review and documentation processes. While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly. Current AI governance approaches consist mainly of manual review and documentation processes. While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\\n, expected_output=The final structured plan in markdown format.\\n), Task(description=Create an ASCII flowchart that visually represents the most important steps of the study plan.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly. Current AI governance approaches consist mainly of manual review and documentation processes. While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\\n\\n\\nThis is the expected criteria for your final answer: The final structured plan in markdown format.\\n\\nyou MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.\\n\\nBegin!

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly. Current AI governance approaches consist mainly of manual review and documentation processes. While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\\n, expected_output=The final structured plan in markdown format.\\n)]\"", "id": "\"b506e5bb-98cc-464a-9100-2fa4ea9a9a58\"", "agent": "\"Final Study Plan ASCII Writer\\n\"", "security_config": "\"version='1.0.0' fingerprint=Fingerprint(uuid_str='7a2d0cdd-1888-43f8-b187-c00407970a32', created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 9, 7, 23, 20, 2, 514444), metadata={})\"", "delegations": "\"0\"", "i18n": "\"prompt_file=None\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"# Efficient Study Plan Structure for Becoming a Better Entry-Level AI Engineer\\n\\n> _Estimated time commitment: 8–12 hours/week recommended.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly.

While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\\n, expected_output=The final structured plan in markdown format.\\n), Task(description=Create an ASCII flowchart that visually represents the most important steps of the study plan.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search.

While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\\n, expected_output=The final structured plan in markdown format.\\n), Task(description=Create an ASCII flowchart that visually represents the most important steps of the study plan.

We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.', 'year': 2024, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540v2'}], 'machine learning model evaluation generalization and robustness': [{'title': 'Robustness of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization Models against Adversarial Attacks', 'authors': 'Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Thomas Villmann', 'abstract': 'Adversarial attacks and the development of (deep) neural networks robust against them are currently two widely researched topics. The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models.', 'year': 2019, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00577v2'}], 'algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in artificial intelligence': [{'title': 'Implementing Fair Regression In The Real World', 'authors': 'Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki', 'abstract': 'Most fair regression algorithms mitigate bias towards sensitive sub populations and therefore improve fairness at group level. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such implementation of fair regression on the individual. More precisely, we assess the evolution of continuous predictions from an unconstrained to a fair algorithm by comparing results from baseline algorithms with fair regression algorithms for the same data points. Based on our findings, we propose a set of post-processing algorithms to improve the utility of the existing fair regression approaches.', 'year': 2021, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04353v1'}], 'mathematical foundations linear algebra and optimization in machine learning': [{'title': 'Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task', 'authors': 'Fernando Martin-Maroto, Nabil Abderrahaman, David Mendez, Gonzalo G. de Polavieja', 'abstract': 'Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.', 'year': 2025, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944v1'}], 'representation learning and data-centric approaches in applied AI': [{'title': 'Data-Centric Governance', 'authors': 'Sean McGregor, Jesse Hostetler', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is the body of standards and practices used to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly. Current AI governance approaches consist mainly of manual review and documentation processes. While such reviews are necessary for many systems, they are not sufficient to systematically address all potential harms, as they do not operationalize governance requirements for system engineering, behavior, and outcomes in a way that facilitates rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Modern AI systems are data-centric: they act on data, produce data, and are built through data engineering. The assurance of governance requirements must also be carried out in terms of data. This work explores the systematization of governance requirements via datasets and algorithmic evaluations. When applied throughout the product lifecycle, data-centric governance decreases time to deployment, increases solution quality, decreases deployment risks, and places the system in a continuous state of assured compliance with governance requirements.', 'year': 2023, 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07872v1'}]}\\n, expected_output=The final structured plan in markdown format.\\n), Task(description=Create an ASCII flowchart that visually represents the most important steps of the study plan.
