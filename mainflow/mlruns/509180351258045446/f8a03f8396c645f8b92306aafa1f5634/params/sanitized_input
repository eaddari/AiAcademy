# Efficient Study Plan for Aspiring Entry-Level AI Engineers (Beginner Level)

## Introduction & Overview

Welcome! This structured study plan is designed to transition beginners into efficient, job-ready entry-level AI engineers. You’ll move from basic concepts to hands-on projects, collaborative learning, and professional portfolio development.

- **Estimated Total Duration**: 18–24 weeks (adjust pace as needed; each section contains suggested timelines)
- **Primary Outcome**: Build foundational knowledge, practical coding skills, and a demonstrable AI/ML portfolio suitable for entry roles or internships.
- **Approach**: Layered learning—read, watch, code, apply, and share. Leverage self-assessment checkpoints, action steps, and peer/community feedback at every stage.

## I. Foundations of AI and Programming *(3–4 weeks)*

### A. Core AI Concepts

1. Brief history and definition of AI.
2. Types of AI: narrow (weak) vs general (strong).
3. AI fields overview: machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision.
4. Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

**Action Step:**  
- Prepare a 2-minute video or a short blog post explaining supervised vs. unsupervised learning to a non-technical friend.
- **Checkpoint:** Can you clearly distinguish and give practical examples of the types of AI?

---

### B. Essential Mathematics

1. Apply basic linear algebra: vectors, matrices, matrix operations in data manipulation.
2. Use elementary probability and statistics: mean, variance, distributions.
3. Grasp key calculus concepts: derivatives and gradients as used in optimization.

**Action Step:**  
- Solve a set of simple Python math exercises (e.g., basic matrix multiplication with NumPy).
- **Checkpoint:** Demonstrate one hands-on example for each topic in a Jupyter notebook.

---

### C. Programming Skills with Python

1. Practice Python syntax: variables, types, loops, conditionals, functions, error handling.
2. Work with standard libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib.
3. Set up Jupyter notebooks for exploration (both local and cloud—e.g., Google Colab).

**Action Step:**  
- Complete one small data wrangling task (e.g., generate and plot sample data).
- **Checkpoint:** Can you write and run basic Python scripts and visualize data in a notebook?

---

## II. Data Handling and Manipulation *(2 weeks)*

### A. Introduction to Data

1. Recognize and describe common data formats: CSV, JSON, XML.
2. Load, inspect, and save datasets using pandas and NumPy.

**Action Step:**  
- Load three different publicly available datasets of various formats.
- **Checkpoint:** Explain to a peer how to read and write data in Python.

---

### B. Data Preprocessing

1. Identify and handle missing/null values and outliers.
2. Apply normalization, encoding (e.g., one-hot), and basic transformation.

**Action Step:**  
- Clean and preprocess the UCI Titanic dataset.
- **Checkpoint:** Create a checklist of preprocessing steps and demonstrate them on a sample dataset.

---

## III. Machine Learning Fundamentals *(4 weeks)*

### A. Key Concepts

1. Define and contrast machine learning vs. deep learning.
2. Examine popular algorithms: linear regression, k-NN, decision trees—via intuition & use cases.
3. Introduce overfitting, underfitting, model evaluation.

**Action Step:**  
- Build a linear regression model with scikit-learn.
- **Checkpoint:** Present algorithm use cases and pitfalls to a study group.

---

### B. Practical Machine Learning

1. Implement supervised learning models in scikit-learn.
2. Split data, use train/test/validation sets, analyze evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, confusion matrix).
3. **Mini-Project:** Build & evaluate a classifier with the Iris dataset.

**Action Step:**  
- Share your Iris project on GitHub with clear README and notebook explanation.
- **Checkpoint:** Can you explain evaluation metrics and the tradeoffs between model types?

## IV. Neural Networks & Deep Learning Basics *(3 weeks)*

### A. Deep Learning Foundations

1. Visualize the structure of neural networks: perceptron, layers, activation functions.
2. Compare TensorFlow vs. PyTorch: install, basic usage.

**Action Step:**  
- Diagram a simple neural net by hand and label its components.
- **Checkpoint:** Implement a perceptron from scratch in Python.

---

### B. Simple Implementation

1. Construct and train a basic neural net (e.g., on MNIST, using TensorFlow or PyTorch).
2. Experiment with different activation functions, optimizers.

**Action Step:**  
- Run a complete MNIST notebook and alter the number of epochs/layers to see how results change.
- **Checkpoint:** Document the process, results, and issues faced in your learning journal.
