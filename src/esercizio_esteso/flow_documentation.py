"""
Documentation Generation Flow for CrewAI Multi-Agent System.

This module implements a comprehensive documentation generation workflow that
uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and specialized AI crews to create
structured technical documentation. The flow coordinates multiple agents to
research, analyze, and synthesize information into professional documentation.

The workflow includes:
- Automated RAG research to gather system information
- Template-based section identification and content generation
- Multi-agent collaboration for comprehensive documentation
- Quality assurance and final report compilation

Classes
-------
DocumentationFlowState : BaseModel
    Pydantic model for managing flow state and data persistence.
DocumentationFlow : Flow
    Main flow class that orchestrates the documentation generation process.

Functions
---------
kickoff : callable
    Entry point function to start the documentation generation flow.
plot : callable
    Function to generate visual representation of the flow structure.

Examples
--------
Run the documentation flow:
    >>> from flow_documentation import kickoff
    >>> result = kickoff()

Generate flow visualization:
    >>> from flow_documentation import plot
    >>> plot()

Notes
-----
The flow uses Azure OpenAI models and requires proper configuration of
environment variables for API access. The RAG system depends on a
pre-indexed knowledge base with relevant system documentation.
